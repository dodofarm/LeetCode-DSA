169.majority-element.py - Boyer Moore Algorithm, voting
1540.can-convert-string-in-k-moves.py - String conversion
215.kth-largest-element-in-an-array.py - Quickselect practice, optional max heap or just sort
283.move-zeroes.py - Think about how to partition the array, what needs to be at the beginning? Maybe move it there
347.top-k-frequent-elements.py - Bucket Sort, find highest frequency
49.group-anagrams.py - never done properly... 
125.valid-palindrome.py - think about how you DON'T have to move both pointers before comparing, you can do so 1 by 1!
219.contains-duplicate-ii.py - Solved but not optimal think of which TECHNIQUE to use, hashmap is only part of it
15.3sum.py - didn't solve this one, think of 2sum and 2sum II
567.permutation-in-string.py - got non-linear time solution, keep in mind exactly HOW sliding windows work (pop, add per move)

repeate one more time:
121.best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock.py - done with hint, simple question - understand what you are measuring and which simple comparison you need
143.reorder-list.py - got it but pretty ineffiecient, think of the easiest way to find the middle of a linked list, think of another problem where you found kth element counted from the end
150.evaluate-reverse-polish-notation.py - done but the technique how and when to order numbers to stack should be revised
205.isomorphic-strings.py - solved once with hint, you need to compare one string with the other AND vice versa
226.invert-binary-tree.py - same as 104, figured out technique but maybe no need for helper function? Just call the main function.

Done:
2.add-two-numbers.py - done but not good time and non-efficiencies in code - think how you can write cleaner/smarter and shorter, remove unnessecary lines
19.remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list.py - done but code might want some optimizations (unnessecary None checks etc.)
20.valid-parentheses.py - done on second try, might repeat since there is a nice concept on how to compare values
21.merge-two-sorted-lists.py - done, maybe repeat for understanding
74.search-a-2d-matrix.py - done with no issues, maybe repeat for understanding of binary search application?
102.binary-tree-level-order-traversal.py - done with little to no issues, maybe repeat to understand some logic stuff - edit: redone with BFS, maybe repeat to understand dequeue BFS
104.maximum-depth-of-binary-tree.py - done with recursive DFS and stack DFS, redo stack solution potentially to solidify stack technique
155.min-stack.py - done, remember CORE idea about how stack works! think of how to store the min value for the current element
167.two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted.py - actually solved without problems, might retry to refresh
199.binary-tree-right-side-view.py - done with custom recursive solution as in 102 (recursive) - also now redone with BFS + deque
206.reverse-linked-list.py - Solved on second try (remember to use multiple vars, not one!) maybe as training to recursive solution
344.reverse-string.py - done, not really worth repeating unless for basic techniques
438.find-all-anagrams-in-a-string.py - done on first try - very similar to 567, maybe repeat with better implementation
643.maximum-average-subarray-i.py - done on first try - maybe repeat to solidify static size sliding window
704.binary-search.py - done, maybe repeat to practice binary search but other problems probably are enough for that
